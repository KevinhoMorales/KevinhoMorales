### My name is Kevin, and I’m deeply passionate about technology. With over 7 years of experience as an iOS and Android developer, I’ve had the privilege of developing and publishing several apps on both the App Store and Play Store—some under my name and others where I’ve contributed my expertise.

### I’m an entrepreneur at heart, constantly seeking new challenges in my professional journey. Every day, I dedicate myself to personal and professional growth, striving to become a better leader and to inspire those around me.

### Podcast host of DevLokos and community lead for GDG Tsáchilas in Santo Domingo, Ecuador.
